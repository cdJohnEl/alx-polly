# AI Response Reflection: Creating Poll Type for EditPollForm

## What Symbol(s) You Used
- `@EditPollForm` - Referenced the component that needed the type definition

## What the AI Produced

The AI created a comprehensive solution that included:

### 1. Type Definitions (`lib/types.ts`)
- **`PollSettings`** for poll options
- **`Poll`** for all poll details
- **`CreatePollData`** for making a new poll
- **`EditPollData`** for editing a poll
- **`PollVote`** for tracking votes

### 2. EditPollForm Component (`components/poll/EditPollForm.tsx`)
- A form with two tabs (Basic Info & Settings)
- Form validation and error handling
- Dynamic option management (add/remove poll options)
- Handles settings (multiple choice, login, end date)
- Proper React state management with useEffect for prop changes

## One Thing That Worked Well
The AI demonstrated excellent understanding of the existing codebase structure and created a type system that consolidated the different poll structures used throughout the project. This shows good code analysis and architectural thinking.

## One Thing That Didn't Work Well
The AI created the `EditPollForm` component even though only the type was asked for. It gave more than needed, which could add extra, unwanted code.
